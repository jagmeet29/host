Electric field intensity is a fundamental concept in electrostatics that describes the strength of an electric field at any given point in space.

## Definition and Formula

Electric field intensity **E** is defined as the negative rate of change of electric potential (voltage) with respect to distance. Mathematically, it is expressed as:

$$E = -\frac{dV}{dx}$$

Where:
- **E** is the electric field intensity
- **V** is the electric potential (voltage)
- **x** is the distance
- The negative sign indicates that the electric field points in the direction of decreasing potential.

## Key Characteristics

## Direction and Magnitude

- The electric field is **always directed toward decreasing potential**.
- If the electric field is in the positive x-direction, it indicates that the potential decreases in that direction.
- Conversely, if the electric field is in the negative x-direction, the potential increases in the positive x-direction.

## Relationship with Potential

- When voltage **V** is constant with respect to distance **x**, the electric field **E** equals zero.
- The electric field represents the **slope of the potential gradient**.
- For a linear potential variation **V = mx + c**, the electric field becomes constant:

$$E = -m$$

## Practical Examples

Consider these numerical examples of electric field calculations.
### Example 1: Decreasing Potential

- **Initial conditions**: **V₁ = 4V** at **x₁ = 1cm**, **V₂ = 2V** at **x₂ = 2cm**
- **Calculation**:

  $$E = -\frac{V₂ - V₁}{x₂ - x₁} = -\frac{2 - 4}{2 - 1} = 2 \frac{V}{cm}$$

- **Result**: Electric field of **2 V/cm** pointing in the positive x-direction.

### Example 2: Increasing Potential

- **Initial conditions**: **V₁ = 2V** at **x₁ = 1cm**, **V₂ = 4V** at **x₂ = 2cm**
- **Calculation**:

  $$E = -\frac{V₂ - V₁}{x₂ - x₁} = -\frac{4 - 2}{2 - 1} = -2 \frac{V}{cm}$$

- **Result**: Electric field of **2 V/cm** pointing in the negative x-direction.

### Physical Significance

The electric field is calculated as the negative gradient of the electric potential. In the first example, the potential decreases with increasing x,
resulting in a positive electric field in the x-direction. In the second example, the potential increases with increasing x, resulting in a negative
electric field (or a positive electric field in the negative x-direction). This relationship is fundamental in electrostatics and is described by the
equation:

$$E = -\frac{dV}{dx}$$

## Physical Significance

Electric field intensity serves several important purposes:
- **Determines force direction**: The electric field indicates the direction a positive charge would experience force.
- **Quantifies field strength**: Higher field intensity values indicate stronger electric fields.
- **Links potential and field**: It provides the mathematical relationship between electric potential and electric field.
- **Creates field maps**: By calculating **E** at various points, we can map the complete electric field distribution.

The concept is essential for understanding how electric charges interact in space and forms the foundation for more advanced electromagnetic theory.
