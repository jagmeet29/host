## Diode Circuits: DC Analysis & Models 

* **Objective:** Analyze DC diode circuits using various models to understand diode characteristics.
* **Nonlinear Circuits:** Diode circuits are nonlinear (unlike resistors with linear I-V relationships). Analysis is more complex but enables functions like DC voltage generation & logic implementation.
* **Circuit Models:** Mathematical models (like Ohm's Law) are crucial for circuit analysis without physical prototyping.

### Diode Models

* **Large-Signal Models:** Describe behavior with significant voltage/current changes – simplifies analysis of complex circuits.
* **Small-Signal Models:**  Describe behavior with *small* voltage/current changes. Important to understand when to use each model.

### Ideal Diode Characteristics

* **Forward Bias:** Conducts current; voltage drop is ideally zero. 
* **Reverse Bias:**  No current flows (open circuit).
* Requires external circuit control for forward current.

### Rectifier Circuit Example 

* **Input:** Sinusoidal voltage $v_I$.
* **Positive Half-Cycle:** Diode is forward-biased (zero voltage drop). Output voltage $v_O$ equals input voltage.
* **Negative Half-Cycle:** Diode is reverse-biased (open circuit); output voltage is zero.
* **Result:** Converts AC to a signal with only positive values (rectification), generating a positive average voltage – a first step in creating DC voltage. 

### DC Analysis Approaches

* **Iteration:** Solving for voltages/currents repeatedly.
* **Graphical Techniques:** Using diode I-V curves to visually solve circuits.
* **Piecewise Linear Modeling:** Approximating the diode’s  I-V curve with linear segments.
* **Computer Analysis:** Utilizing software for circuit simulation.
