**Drift current** is the flow of electric current that occurs when charge carriers (electrons and holes) move through a material under the influence of an applied electric field. When you apply a voltage across a conductor or semiconductor, the electric field causes the charge carriers to "drift" in a preferred direction, creating this current.

## Current Density

**Current density (J)** represents the amount of current flowing per unit cross-sectional area of the material. It's measured in units like A/cm² or mA/cm². The basic relationship is:

$$J=\frac{I}{A}$$

Where:
- J = current density
- I = total current
- A = cross-sectional area

## Mathematical Relationships

### General Formula

The fundamental equation for drift current density is:

$$J=\sigma E$$

Where:
- σ (sigma) = conductivity of the material
- E = electric field intensity

### For Metals

In metals, the drift current density is given by:

$$J_m = \sigma_n E$$

Here, σₙ represents the conductivity due to electrons (the primary charge carriers in metals).

### For Semiconductors

Semiconductors have both electrons and holes as charge carriers, so:

$$J_{sc} = \sigma E = (\sigma_n + \sigma_p)E = \sigma_n E + \sigma_p E$$

Where:
- σₙ = conductivity due to electrons
- σₚ = conductivity due to holes

This shows that the total current in a semiconductor is the sum of electron current and hole current.

## Sign and Direction

The **sign of drift current density** depends on the direction of the electric field:
- If you take the electric field E with a certain magnitude and sign
- The drift current density will have the same sign as the electric field
- This means the current flows in the direction determined by the field and the type of charge carriers

## Key Takeaways

1. **Drift current** is fundamentally different from other current mechanisms (like diffusion current)
2. **Current density** gives you the current per unit area, making it easier to compare different materials
3. **Metals** primarily use electrons for conduction
4. **Semiconductors** use both electrons and holes, making their analysis more complex
5. The **direction** of current depends on both the electric field direction and the type of charge carriers

This concept is fundamental in understanding how electronic devices like diodes, transistors, and solar cells operate.
