## What is Conductivity?

**Conductivity (σ)** represents the current-carrying capacity of a material or device. It is fundamentally defined by the relationship:

$$
\sigma = (\text{charge}) \times (\text{concentration of charge carriers}) \times
(\text{mobility of charge carriers})
$$

The units of conductivity are **S/m** (siemens per meter) or **Ω⁻¹·cm⁻¹** (ohm inverse per centimeter).

## Conductivity in Metals

In metals, **only electrons act as free charge carriers**. This leads to:

$$
\sigma = q \times n \times \mu_n
$$

Where:
- $q$ = charge of electron
- $n$ = concentration of electrons
- $\mu_n$ = mobility of electrons

Since the concentration of electrons is **extremely high** in metals, this results in metals having **very high conductivity**.

## Conductivity in Semiconductors

Semiconductors have a more complex behavior because they contain **two types of charge carriers**:

### 1. **Electrons** (negative charge carriers)

- Contribution to conductivity:
  $$
  \sigma_n = q \times n \times \mu_n
  $$

### 2. **Holes** (positive charge carriers)

- Contribution to conductivity:
  $$
  \sigma_p = q \times p \times \mu_p
  $$

### Total Semiconductor Conductivity

The **overall conductivity** combines both contributions:

$$
\sigma = \sigma_n + \sigma_p = q \times n \times \mu_n + q \times p \times \mu_p
$$

## Current Flow Direction

An important principle about charge carrier movement:

- **Electrons and holes always flow in opposite directions**.
- However, they **contribute current in the same direction**.
- Current direction follows the **electric field direction**:
  - **Positive current**: flows in the +x direction.
  - **Negative current**: flows in the -x direction.

This dual-carrier system makes semiconductors unique compared to metals, allowing for more complex electrical behaviors that are essential in electronic devices like diodes, transistors, and solar cells.
