## Scattering in Semiconductors: Fundamental Mechanisms and High-Field Effects

### Definition of Scattering

**Scattering** is the process by which charge carriers (electrons and holes) are deflected from their original trajectory due to interactions with various obstacles in the semiconductor crystal lattice. This phenomenon is the primary mechanism that limits carrier mobility and determines the electrical properties of semiconductor materials.

### Physical Picture of Scattering

#### Basic Concept

Imagine charge carriers as particles moving through a crystal lattice. Without any obstacles, they would accelerate continuously under an applied electric field. However, the crystal contains various "obstacles" that cause carriers to:
- **Change direction** (deflection)
- **Lose energy** (energy dissipation)
- **Experience resistance** to motion

#### Scattering Process

1. **Initial state**: Carrier moving with certain velocity and direction
2. **Interaction**: Carrier encounters a scattering center
3. **Deflection**: Carrier trajectory is altered
4. **Final state**: Carrier continues with new velocity and direction

### Types of Scattering Mechanisms

#### 1. Lattice Scattering (Phonon Scattering)

**Physical Origin:**
- Thermal vibrations of crystal lattice atoms
- Quantized lattice vibrations called **phonons**
- Dominant at higher temperatures

**Characteristics:**
- **Temperature dependence**: Increases with temperature ($μ \propto T^{-3/2}$)
- **Intrinsic mechanism**: Present in perfect crystals
- **Thermal activation**: More phonons at higher temperatures

**Mathematical Description:**
$$μ_{lattice} = AT^{-3/2}$$

where A is a material constant.

#### 2. Impurity Scattering (Ionized Impurity Scattering)

**Physical Origin:**
- Ionized dopant atoms in the crystal
- Coulomb interaction between carriers and charged impurities
- Dominant at lower temperatures and high doping levels

**Characteristics:**
- **Temperature dependence**: Decreases with temperature ($μ \propto T^{3/2}$)
- **Doping dependence**: Increases with impurity concentration
- **Coulomb nature**: Long-range electrostatic interaction

**Mathematical Description:**
$$μ_{impurity} = BT^{3/2}N_i^{-1}$$

where B is a constant and $N_i$ is the ionized impurity concentration.

#### 3. Neutral Impurity Scattering

**Physical Origin:**
- Scattering by neutral impurity atoms
- Short-range interaction
- Less significant than ionized impurity scattering

**Characteristics:**
- **Temperature independence**: Relatively constant with temperature
- **Concentration dependence**: Proportional to neutral impurity density

#### 4. Carrier-Carrier Scattering

**Physical Origin:**
- Coulomb repulsion between like charges
- Becomes significant at high carrier concentrations
- Important in heavily doped materials

**Characteristics:**
- **Concentration dependence**: Increases with carrier density
- **Temperature dependence**: Complex relationship
- **Screening effects**: Reduced by carrier screening

### Combined Scattering Effects

#### Matthiessen's Rule

Different scattering mechanisms act independently, and their effects combine according to:
$$ \frac{1}{μ_{total}} = \frac{1}{μ_{lattice}} + \frac{1}{μ_{impurity}} + \frac{1}{μ_{neutral}} + \frac{1}{μ_{carrier-carrier}} $$

#### Temperature Dependence

The total mobility shows characteristic temperature behavior:
- **Low temperatures**: Impurity scattering dominates ($μ \propto T^{3/2}$)
- **High temperatures**: Lattice scattering dominates ($μ \propto T^{-3/2}$)
- **Peak mobility**: Occurs at intermediate temperatures

### High-Field Scattering Mechanisms

#### Definition

**High-field scattering** refers to additional scattering mechanisms that become significant when carriers gain substantial kinetic energy from strong electric fields. These mechanisms are negligible at low fields but dominate transport at high electric fields.

#### Physical Context

In high electric fields:
- Carriers gain energy faster than they lose it through normal scattering
- Carrier temperature exceeds lattice temperature (**hot carriers**)
- New scattering mechanisms become activated
- Non-equilibrium transport conditions prevail

#### Types of High-Field Scattering

##### 1. Optical Phonon Scattering

**Physical Mechanism:**
- Carriers gain enough energy to emit optical phonons
- Optical phonons have higher energy than acoustic phonons
- Becomes dominant energy loss mechanism at high fields

**Characteristics:**
- **Energy threshold**: Requires carrier energy > optical phonon energy
- **Strong coupling**: Efficient energy transfer mechanism
- **Velocity saturation**: Leads to constant drift velocity

**Mathematical Description:**
At high fields, the scattering rate becomes:
$$ \frac{1}{τ} = \frac{1}{τ_{optical}} + \frac{1}{τ_{acoustic}} $$

##### 2. Intervalley Scattering

**Physical Mechanism:**
- Carriers transition between different energy valleys
- Requires minimum carrier energy
- Affects transport properties due to effective mass change

**Process:**
1. Carrier gains energy in one valley
2. Reaches energy threshold for intervalley transition
3. Scatters to different valley with different effective mass
4. Results in reduced mobility

**Characteristics:**
- **Valley-dependent**: Depends on band structure
- **Energy threshold**: Requires minimum carrier energy
- **Effective mass change**: Affects transport properties

##### 3. Impact Ionization

**Physical Mechanism:**
- Very high-energy carriers create electron-hole pairs
- Requires carrier energy > bandgap energy
- Leads to avalanche multiplication

**Process:**
1. Carrier gains energy > $E_g$
2. Collides with valence electron
3. Creates additional electron-hole pair
4. Avalanche effect possible

**Characteristics:**
- **Energy threshold**: $E_{carrier} > E_g$
- **Multiplication effect**: Creates additional carriers
- **Breakdown mechanism**: Can lead to device breakdown

### Field-Dependent Scattering Regimes

#### Low Electric Field Regime (E < 10² V/cm)

**Dominant Mechanisms:**
- Lattice scattering (phonons)
- Impurity scattering
- Carrier-carrier scattering

**Characteristics:**
- **Thermal equilibrium**: Carriers in equilibrium with lattice
- **Constant mobility**: Field-independent scattering rates
- **Linear transport**: Ohm's law applies

#### Moderate Electric Field Regime (10² < E < 10⁴ V/cm)

**Transition Mechanisms:**
- Onset of high-field effects
- Increased optical phonon scattering
- Beginning of hot carrier effects

**Characteristics:**
- **Warm carriers**: Carrier temperature slightly above lattice
- **Mobility decrease**: $μ \propto E^{-1/2}$
- **Sub-linear transport**: Deviation from Ohm's law

#### High Electric Field Regime (E > 10⁴ V/cm)

**Dominant Mechanisms:**
- **Optical phonon scattering**: Primary energy loss mechanism
- **Intervalley scattering**: In multi-valley materials
- **Hot carrier effects**: Significant energy distribution

**Characteristics:**
- **Hot carriers**: $T_{carrier} >> T_{lattice}$
- **Velocity saturation**: Constant drift velocity
- **Energy balance**: Scattering rate balances field acceleration

### Mathematical Treatment

#### Scattering Time

The average time between scattering events is the **scattering time** ($τ$):
$$ μ = \frac{qτ}{m^*} $$

where $m^*$ is the effective mass.

#### High-Field Mobility

At high fields, mobility becomes field-dependent:
$$ μ(E) = \frac{μ_0}{1 + \left(\frac{E}{E_c}\right)^{\beta}} $$

where:
- $μ_0$ = low-field mobility
- $E_c$ = critical field
- $β$ = field dependence parameter (typically 1-2)

#### Saturation Velocity

The saturation velocity is determined by the balance between energy gain and loss:
$$ v_{sat} = \sqrt{\frac{2qτ_{optical}E_{optical}}{m^*}} $$

where $E_{optical}$ is the optical phonon energy.

### Practical Implications
