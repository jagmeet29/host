**Resistivity (ρ)** is a fundamental material property that measures how strongly a material opposes the flow of electric current. It's defined as:

$$ρ = R × A/l$$

Where:

- R = resistance (Ω)
- A = cross-sectional area (cm²)
- l = length (cm)

## Understanding Specific Resistance

Resistivity is also called **specific resistance** because it represents the resistance offered by a material having:

- **Unit cross-sectional area** (1 cm²)
- **Unit length** (1 cm)

This standardization allows us to compare different materials independent of their physical dimensions.

## Relationship Between Resistance and Resistivity

The **resistance formula** shows how resistivity relates to actual resistance:

$$R = ρl/A$$

This tells us that:

- **Longer materials** have higher resistance (R ∝ l)
- **Thicker materials** have lower resistance (R ∝ 1/A)
- **Higher resistivity materials** have higher resistance (R ∝ ρ)

## Units and Measurements

- **Resistivity units**: Ω-cm (ohm-centimeter)
- **Resistance units**: Ω (ohms)
- The conversion: Ω-cm² → Ω-cm shown in your notes

## Connection to Conductivity

The relationship between **conductivity (σ)** and **resistivity (ρ)** is:

$$σ = 1/ρ$$

This means:

- **High resistivity** = **Low conductivity** (insulators)
- **Low resistivity** = **High conductivity** (conductors like metals)

## Applications in Materials

For **metals and semiconductors**:

- **Metals**: Very low resistivity (high conductivity)
- **Semiconductors**: Moderate resistivity (controllable conductivity)
- **Insulators**: Very high resistivity (low conductivity)

The formulas at the bottom of your image show conductivity expressions for semiconductors, connecting back to our previous discussion about electron and hole contributions to electrical conduction.
