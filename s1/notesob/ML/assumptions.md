## Making Smart Guesses: Assumptions & How We Keep Score ðŸŽ¯

### Assumptionsâ€”Your ML Crystal Ball ðŸ”®

Think of **assumptions** as your educated guesses about how the world works. They're like setting the rules of the game before you start playing! Here are some common assumptions we make:

- **The data are independent and identically distributed (IID)** ðŸ“Š  
  This is like saying "every data point is a fair coin flip"â€”each one doesn't affect the others, and they all come from the same process.

- **The data are generated by a Markov chain** ðŸ”—  
  Here, what happens next only depends on what's happening right now (not the whole history). Think of it like a weather patternâ€”tomorrow's weather mainly depends on today's, not what happened last month.

- **The process generating the data might be adversarial** ðŸ˜ˆ  
  Sometimes the world is actively trying to trick you! Like spam emails that keep evolving to avoid detection.

- **The "true" model can be perfectly described by one of our hypotheses** ðŸŽ¯  
  We assume the real answer is somewhere in our toolboxâ€”we just need to find it.

**Why bother with assumptions?**  
They help us narrow down the **space of possible hypotheses**, making it easier to find the right answer with less data. It's like going from searching an entire library to just looking in the right section! ðŸ“š
