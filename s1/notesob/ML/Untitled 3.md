## Learning Linear Classifiers

Finding the linear classifier with the smallest possible training error is a **well-formed optimization problem**, but it's **computationally challenging**. The hypothesis class of linear classifiers involves finding optimal parameters $θ$ (weight vector) and $θ₀$ (bias term) that minimize classification errors on the training set.
- ## Random-Linear-Classifier Algorithm
  
  The **Random-Linear-Classifier** takes a simple approach to this difficult optimization problem:
  
  1. **Generate k random hypotheses**: For each iteration $j = 1$ to $k$, randomly sample parameter pairs $(θ^{(j)}, θ₀^{(j)})$ from $(ℝᵈ, ℝ)$
  2. **Evaluate training error**: Compute the training error $Eₙ(θ^{(j)}, θ₀^{(j)})$ for each hypothesis
  3. **Select best performer**: Return the hypothesis $j^*$ that achieves the minimum training error
  
  This is essentially a **random search** strategy that relies on generating many random candidates and picking the best one.
- ## Study Question Analysis
- ### Effect of Increasing k on $Eₙ(h)$
  
  As **k increases**, $Eₙ(h)$ will generally **decrease** or stay the same. Here's why:
- With more random samples, you're more likely to find a hypothesis that fits the training data better
- The minimum over a larger set of random hypotheses can only be better (or equal to) the minimum over a smaller set
- However, the **improvement rate will diminish** - going from $k=2$ to $k=10$ will likely show more improvement than going from $k=1000$ to $k=1008$
- ### Properties of $Dₙ$ That Affect $Eₙ(h)$
  
  Several characteristics of the training dataset $Dₙ$ will influence the training error:
- **Dataset size (n)**: Larger datasets are generally harder to fit perfectly with random hypotheses
- **Dimensionality (d)**: Higher-dimensional feature spaces give random hypotheses more flexibility
- **Data distribution**: Linearly separable data will be easier for linear classifiers to fit
- **Noise level**: Datasets with more label noise or outliers will be harder to fit perfectly
- **Data complexity**: Simple, well-structured patterns are more likely to be captured by random linear classifiers
- ## Cross-Validation for Algorithm Evaluation
- ### The Cross-Validation Process
  
  The **Cross-Validate** algorithm provides a systematic way to evaluate learning algorithms:
  
  1. **Divide data**: Split dataset $D$ into $k$ roughly equal chunks $D₁, D₂, ..., Dₖ$
  2. **Train and test**: For each chunk $i$:
	- Train hypothesis $hᵢ$ on $D \ Dᵢ$ (all data except chunk $i$)
	- Compute test error $εᵢ(hᵢ)$ on the withheld chunk $Dᵢ$
	  3. **Average results**: Return the mean test error: $(1/k)∑_{i=1}^{k} εᵢ(hᵢ)$
- ### Sources of Variability
  
  When evaluating learning algorithms, we must account for multiple sources of randomness:
- **Training set variability**: Different training examples $Dₙ$ can lead to different results
- **Test set variability**: Different test examples $Dₙ'$ affect performance measurements

- **Algorithm randomness**: Internal randomization (like in Random-Linear-Classifier) introduces variability
- ### Key Insight: Algorithm vs. Hypothesis Evaluation
  
  **Cross-validation evaluates the learning algorithm, not a specific hypothesis.** This is a crucial distinction:
- A single hypothesis $h$ has fixed performance on any given test set
- A learning algorithm's performance varies based on what training data it receives
- Cross-validation estimates how well the algorithm will perform when given new training sets
  
  The ideal evaluation process involves:
  
  1. Training on multiple independent training sets
  2. Testing each resulting hypothesis on separate test sets
  3. Averaging performance across multiple runs
  
  Cross-validation approximates this ideal when data is limited, allowing us to **reuse data efficiently** while still getting meaningful estimates of algorithm performance. However, this reuse makes theoretical analysis more complex compared to using completely independent train/test splits.
