Comments not executed they are ignored by the compiler. In python comments can be declared as follows:

## Single Line Comments

```python
# single line comment
print("hi") # comment along side code
```

 A single line comment `#` extends till the end of the line and and be written along side the code.

Short Cut Key for comment in windows $\rightarrow$ `ctrl + /`

## Multiline Comments

```python
# ------------------------
# multiline comment
# ------------------------
```

or 

```python
'''
multiline comment
```

## Why Comments

1. Rather than removing the error code we can make it a comment.
2. For future reference
3. For Debugging
4. Helping others to understand the code
