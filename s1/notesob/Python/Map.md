The **`map()` function** in Python is a built-in tool that allows you to apply a function to every item in an iterable (such as a list or tuple) without needing to write an explicit loop.

## How `map()` Works

*   **Syntax:**
    *   `code_line map(function, iterable)`
    *   `code_line function`: The function you want to apply to each element.
    *   `code_line iterable`: The collection (like a list) whose items you want to process.
*   **What it returns:**
    `code_line map()` returns a **map object**, which is an **iterator**. You can convert this to a list or other collection if you want to see the results directly.

## Example

Suppose you have a list of strings representing numbers, and you want to convert each string to an integer:

```python
s = ['1', '2', '3', '4']
res = map(int, s)
print(list(res)) # Output: [1, 2, 3, 4]
```

Here, `code_line int()` is applied to each element of s.

## Why use `map()`?

*   **Cleaner code:** You avoid writing manual loops.
*   **Efficient:** It processes items one by one as needed (**lazy evaluation**).
*   **Flexible:** You can use it with any function, including **built-in functions**, **lambdas**, or **your own functions**.
