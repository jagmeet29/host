**Use this format for Q&A:**

  >[!question] question_number. question_content ? 
  >>[!success]- Answer
  >> Answer_content

Edit this in Such a way that Inside blog quotes only use <br>for new line





example 

>[!question] What is the result of A ⊕ A?
>>[!success]- Answer
>> A ⊕ A = 0<br> **Explanation:** When any variable is XORed with itself, the result is always 0. This is<br> because:<br> A ⊕ A = Ā·A + A·Ā = 0 + 0 = 0

>[!question] What is the result of Ā ⊕ A (or A' ⊕ A)?
>>[!success]- Answer
>> Ā ⊕ A = 1<br> **Explanation:** When a variable is XORed with its complement, the result is always 1. This is<br> because:<br> Ā ⊕ A = Ā·Ā + A·A = Ā + A = 1
