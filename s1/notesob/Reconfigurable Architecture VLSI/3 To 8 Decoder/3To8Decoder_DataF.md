```verilog 
module decoder_dataflow(
  input en,
  input [2:0] in,
  output [7:0] out
);
  // Using the shift operator for a one-hot (only one bit high) output.
  assign out = en ? (1 << in) : 8'b0;
endmodule

```
## Explanation of the Code

- **Module Declaration and Port List**  
    The module is defined with the name `decoder_dataflow` and has three ports:
    
    - `en`: a single-bit enable input that determines whether the decoder is active.
        
    - `in`: a 3-bit input (`[2:0]`) that selects which output line should be asserted.
        
    - `out`: an 8-bit output (`[7:0]`) that will carry the one-hot encoded value[2](https://vlsigyan.com/verilog-code-of-decoder-3-to-8-decoder-verilog-code/).
        
- **Continuous Assignment Statement**  
    The key line in the module is:
    
    verilog
    
    `assign out = en ? (1 << in) : 8'b0;`
    
    This is a continuous assignment that continuously drives the `out` signal depending on the values of `en` and `in`:
    
    - The ternary operator `?:` checks the condition `en`.
        
    - If `en` is true (logic high), the expression `(1 << in)` is evaluated.
        
    - If `en` is false (logic low), then the output is set to `8'b0` (all bits off)[2](https://vlsigyan.com/verilog-code-of-decoder-3-to-8-decoder-verilog-code/).
        
- **Understanding the Shift Operator (`<<`) and One-Hot Encoding**  
    The left shift operator `<<` takes the binary number `1` and shifts it left by the number of positions specified by `in`. This operation creates a one-hot encoding because:
    
    - For `in = 3'b000`, the expression evaluates to `1 << 0`, which results in `8'b00000001`.
        
    - For `in = 3'b001`, it becomes `1 << 1`, yielding `8'b00000010`.
        
    - For `in = 3'b010`, it results in `1 << 2`, which is `8'b00000100`.
        
    - This pattern continues up to `in = 3'b111`, resulting in `8'b10000000`.  
        In each case, exactly one bit in the 8-bit vector is set to 1, which is why the output is referred to as one-hot[2](https://vlsigyan.com/verilog-code-of-decoder-3-to-8-decoder-verilog-code/).
        
- **Behavior When the Enable Signal is Inactive**  
    If the enable signal `en` is false, the entire output is forced to zero (`8'b0`), regardless of the value of `in`. This ensures that the decoder does not produce a valid one-hot output unless it is enabled[2](https://vlsigyan.com/verilog-code-of-decoder-3-to-8-decoder-verilog-code/).
    

## Summary

This dataflow style decoder uses a concise continuous assignment to achieve one-hot encoding. The code effectively converts a 3-bit input into an 8-bit one-hot output when enabled, providing an example of how a shift operator can be used to simplify decoder design. Each section of the code—module declaration, continuous assignment, and the use of the shift operator—serves to illustrate how Verilog can describe hardware with varying levels of abstraction in a clear and efficient manner[2](https://vlsigyan.com/verilog-code-of-decoder-3-to-8-decoder-verilog-code/).
