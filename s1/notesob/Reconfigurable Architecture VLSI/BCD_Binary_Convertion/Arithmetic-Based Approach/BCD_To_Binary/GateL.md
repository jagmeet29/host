## Explanation of Multiplication by 10

- In Verilog, the left shift operator (<<) shifts all bits of a number to the left by the specified number of positions. Shifting a number left by 3 positions means multiplying the number by $2^3=8$, while shifting left by 1 multiplies it by $2^1=2$.

- In the module `mult_by_10`, the multiplication by 10 is achieved with the expression:  
  $\text{result}=(a\ll3)+(a\ll1)$  
  Here, $(a\ll3)$ calculates $a\times8$ and $(a\ll1)$ calculates $a\times2$; the sum $8a+2a$ equals $10a$. This method is efficient in hardware because it avoids using dedicated multiplication circuitry by instead using shifts and addition.

## Extending the Idea to Multiply by 100 and 1000

- Module `mult_by_100`:  
  This module first multiplies the 4-bit input `a` by 10 (using the existing `mult_by_10` module), storing the 8-bit result in a temporary wire `temp`. Then, it applies the same shifting method to `temp` to multiply it by 10 again. This effectively computes $(a\times10)\times10=a\times100$.

- Module `mult_by_1000`:  
  Similarly, this module instantiates `mult_by_100` to multiply the 4-bit number by 100. It then multiplies the 12-bit intermediate result by 10 using the same shift-add technique, resulting in $a\times1000$.

## Integration in a BCD-to-Binary Converter

- The top-level module `bcd2bin_gate` shows how these multiplication modules are used to convert a four-digit BCD (each digit represented by 4 bits) into its binary equivalent:
  - `bcd[15:12]` (thousands digit) is multiplied by 1000.
  - `bcd[11:8]` (hundreds digit) is multiplied by 100.
  - `bcd[7:4]` (tens digit) is multiplied by 10.
  - `bcd[3:0]` (ones digit) is used directly.
  
- Each of these partial results is extended to a common bit width before summing them up to form the final binary output. This structural approach illustrates how arithmetic operations at the gate level can be composed to perform higher-level functions such as BCD-to-binary conversion.

## Summary

By using left shifts and additions, this code efficiently multiplies a 4-bit number by 10â€”avoiding costly multiplication circuitsâ€”and builds on that approach to achieve multiplications by 100 and 1000 for converting BCD digits to their weighted binary values. This method is central in arithmetic-based conversions and is a common technique in structural Verilog design.
