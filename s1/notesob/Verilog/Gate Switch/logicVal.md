# Logic Value Handling in Verilog Gates

### Why Does This Matter?
Digital circuits (and simulations in Verilog) don't only use `0` and `1`. Sometimes, signals can be in unknown (`x`) or high-impedance (`z`) states. Understanding how gates react to these is essential for correct design and debugging!

### The Four Logic States
- `0` (logic low)
- `1` (logic high)
- `x` (unknown – could be `0` or `1`; used for uninitialized, conflicting, or uncertain signals)
- `z` (high impedance – "disconnected," like an unconnected wire)

### How Primitive Gates React: Truth Table
Here's a table showing how some basic gates deal with all these values:

|Input 1|Input 2|AND Output|OR Output|XOR Output|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|$0$|$0$|$0$|$0$|$0$|
|$0$|$1$|$0$|$1$|$1$|
|$1$|$1$|$1$|$1$|$0$|
|$1$|$x$|$x$|$1$|$x$|
|$0$|$x$|$0$|$x$|$x$|
|$1$|$z$|$x$|$x$|$x$|
|$z$|$x$|$x$|$x$|$x$|

- **`x` Propagation:** Many gates will output `x` if any input is `x` or `z` (especially if it’s possible for the real result to be ambiguous).
- **`z` Handling:** A `z` (high impedance) input behaves much like `x` for logical calculation purposes in gates. The output could become `x` since it’s not a strong logic level.

### AND Gate Example
```verilog
wire y;
and g1 (y, a, b);
// If a = 1, b = x -> y = x
// If a = 0, b = x -> y = 0
// If a = 1, b = z -> y = x
```

### OR Gate Example
```verilog
wire y;
or g2 (y, a, b);
// If a = 1, b = z -> y = 1
// If a = 0, b = z -> y = x
// If a = x, b = z -> y = x
```

### Why This Happens?
- If **any input is ambiguous** (`x` or `z`), and the _output cannot be determined_ for sure, the gate outputs `x`.
- This helps simulate real-life chip behavior, where uncertain wiring leads to uncertain logic.

### Simple Summary of the Rules
- **Zero dominates AND gates.** If any input is `0`, AND output is `0`—even if others are `x`.
- **One dominates OR gates.** If any input is `1`, OR output is `1`—even if others are `x`.
- **For `x` and `z`:**
  - If the result can’t be decided, the output is `x` (unknown).
  - High-impedance (`z`) usually causes the output to be `x`.

### Test It Yourself in Simulation
To see how gates respond, you can simulate a code like this:

```verilog
module logic_values_demo;
reg a, b;
wire and_out, or_out, xor_out;
and u1 (and_out, a, b);
or u2 (or_out, a, b);
xor u3 (xor_out, a, b);
initial begin
a = 1'b0;
b = 1'bx;
#1;
$display("a=0 b=x : and=%b or=%b xor=%b", and_out, or_out, xor_out);
a = 1'b1;
b = 1'bz;
#1;
$display("a=1 b=z : and=%b or=%b xor=%b", and_out, or_out, xor_out);
a = 1'bx;
b = 1'bz;
#1;
$display("a=x b=z : and=%b or=%b xor=%b", and_out, or_out, xor_out);
end
endmodule
```

**Try running this in your simulator—and check the outputs!**

### Key Word Explained: `x` (Unknown), `z` (High-Z)
- **`x`:** "I don’t know this signal’s value."
- **`z`:** "This wire is not driving anything (floating)."
- **Why useful?** They help catch bugs early by revealing unintended or incomplete designs in simulation.
