# Switch Level Modeling in Verilog

Switch level modeling in Verilog provides a **fundamental approach to modeling digital circuits at the transistor level**. It forms a crucial abstraction layer between the logic level and analog-transistor levels of circuit description.

## What is Switch Level Modeling?

Switch level modeling describes digital circuits using **transmission gates which are abstractions of individual MOS and CMOS transistors**. At this level, transistors are modeled as simple on-off switches that can either conduct or not conduct. The switches are available as primitives in Verilog and are central to design description at this level.

## MOS Switch Primitives

### Basic MOS Switches

Verilog provides several primitive switches for modeling MOS transistors:

- **NMOS and PMOS Switches:**
  - `nmos` - models NMOS transistors
  - `pmos` - models PMOS transistors
  - `cmos` - models complementary MOS switches

**Syntax for instantiation:**
```verilog
nmos n1(out, data, control); // instantiate NMOS switch
pmos p1(out, data, control); // instantiate PMOS switch
```

The instance name is optional for switch primitives:
```verilog
nmos (out, data, control); // no instance name required
pmos (out, data, control); // no instance name required
```

### Switch Operation

**NMOS Switch Behavior:**
- When control signal = 1, the switch conducts
- When control signal = 0, output has high impedance (Z state)

**PMOS Switch Behavior:**
- When control signal = 0, the switch conducts
- When control signal = 1, output has high impedance

### Resistive Switches

Verilog also provides resistive counterparts of the basic switches:
- `rnmos` - resistive NMOS
- `rpmos` - resistive PMOS
- `rcmos` - resistive CMOS

### Bidirectional Switches

Switch level modeling includes **bidirectional switches that can transmit signals in either direction**. These switches connect nets on either side when on and isolate them when off.

### Types of Bidirectional Switches

1. **`tran`** - Simple bidirectional connection
   ```verilog
   tran(s1, s2); // connects signals s1 and s2 directly
   ```
2. **`tranif1`** - Bidirectional switch controlled by a signal
   ```verilog
   tranif1(s1, s2, control); // connects when control = 1
   ```
3. **`tranif0`** - Bidirectional switch with inverse control
   ```verilog
   tranif0(s1, s2, control); // connects when control = 0
   ```
4. **Resistive versions:** `rtran`, `rtranif1`, `rtranif0`

## Power Supply Modeling

In switch level modeling, **power and ground sources must be defined** to provide supply to the signals:
```verilog
supply1 pwr; // power supply (Vcc)
supply0 gnd; // ground (GND)
```

## Signal Strengths

Verilog uses a **signal strength system** where different driving strengths are assigned to outputs. When multiple drivers with different strengths drive the same net, the strongest driver determines the final output value. Common strength levels include:
- `supply1/supply0` - highest strength
- `strong1/strong0` - strong drive
- `pull1/pull0` - pull strength
- `weak1/weak0` - weak drive

## Timing and Delays

**Delays can be specified for switch primitives** to model propagation times:
```verilog
nmos(delay_r, delay_f, delay_o) g4(out, in, ctrl);
```
Where:
- `delay_r` - rise time delay
- `delay_f` - fall time delay
- `delay_o` - turn-off delay

For bidirectional switches:
```verilog
tranif1(delay_r, delay_f) g5(out, in, ctrl);
```

## Practical Example: CMOS NOR Gate

Here's how to implement a **CMOS NOR gate using switch level modeling**:
```verilog
module my_nor(out, a, b);
  output out;
  input a, b;
  wire c;
  // Power and ground
  supply1 pwr; // Vdd
  supply0 gnd; // Vss
  // PMOS switches (pull-up network)
  pmos (c, pwr, b);
  pmos (out, c, a);
  // NMOS switches (pull-down network)
  nmos (out, gnd, a);
  nmos (out, gnd, b);
endmodule
```

## Applications and Usage

Switch level modeling is particularly useful for:
- **Low-level circuit design** where transistor-level control is needed
- **Custom digital circuit implementation** using MOS technology
- **Educational purposes** to understand transistor behavior
- **Verification of logic gates** at the transistor level

## Advantages and Limitations

**Advantages:**
- Provides direct control over transistor-level behavior
- Allows modeling of complex switching circuits
- Supports both unidirectional and bidirectional data flow

**Limitations:**
- **Higher complexity** compared to gate-level modeling
- Less commonly used in modern design due to increased circuit complexity
- Requires deeper understanding of transistor operation

Switch level modeling in Verilog offers a powerful way to describe digital circuits at the transistor level while maintaining the abstraction necessary for practical design work. It bridges the gap between high-level logic description and detailed analog circuit modeling.
