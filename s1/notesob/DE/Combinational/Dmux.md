# Digital Demultiplexer (DEMUX)  
A digital demultiplexer (DEMUX) is a combinational logic circuit that takes a single input signal and distributes it to one of several output lines based on the values of control signals. It is the opposite of a multiplexer, which combines multiple inputs into a single output.

## Key Features of a Digital Demultiplexer  
1. **Structure**:  
   - A demultiplexer has **one input**, **n select lines**, and $2^n$ output lines.  
   - The select lines determine which output line receives the input signal.  

2. **Functionality**:  
   - It acts as a "data distributor," routing the input signal to one of its multiple outputs.  
   - For example, in a **1-to-4 DEMUX**, one input is distributed to four outputs depending on the 2-bit control signals.  

3. **Logic Expression**:  
   - For a 1-to-4 DEMUX:  
     $$
     Y_0 = I \cdot S'_1 \cdot S'_0
     $$  
     $$
     Y_1 = I \cdot S'_1 \cdot S_0
     $$  
     $$
     Y_2 = I \cdot S_1 \cdot S'_0
     $$  
     $$
     Y_3 = I \cdot S_1 \cdot S_0
     $$  
   Where $I$ is the input signal, $S_0, S_1$ are select lines, and $Y_0, Y_1, Y_2, Y_3$ are outputs.

## Types of Demultiplexers  
1. **1-to-2 DEMUX**:  
   - One input, one select line, two outputs.  
   - Truth table example:  

     | Input | Select | Output 0 | Output 1 |  
     |-------|--------|----------|----------|  
     |   0   |    0   |    0     |    0     |  
     |   1   |    0   |    1     |    0     |  
     |   1   |    1   |    0     |    1     |  

2. **1-to-4 DEMUX**:  
   - One input, two select lines, four outputs.  

3. **Higher-order DEMUX**:  
   - Larger configurations like **1-to-8** or **1-to-16** can be created by cascading smaller DEMUX circuits.

## Designing an n-Bit Demultiplexer  
To design an $n$-bit demultiplexer:  
1. Determine the number of outputs ($2^n$) based on the number of select lines ($n$).  
2. Create a truth table mapping select line combinations to output activation.  
3. Derive logic expressions for each output line using AND gates and NOT gates.  
4. Implement the circuit using basic gates or programmable logic devices like FPGAs or ICs (e.g., IC 74139 for dual 1-to-4 DEMUX).
