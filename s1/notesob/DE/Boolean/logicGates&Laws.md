## Logic Gates and Boolean Algebra Laws

Logic gates follow several fundamental **Boolean algebra laws** that determine their behavior and enable circuit design and simplification. These laws demonstrate mathematical relationships between different gate configurations and help engineers optimize digital circuits.

## Core Boolean Laws for Logic Gates

### Commutative Law

The order of inputs doesn't affect the output for symmetric operations:

- **AND**: $A \cdot B = B \cdot A$
- **OR**: $A + B = B + A$

**Applicable gates**: AND, OR, NAND, NOR gates follow this law because they treat all inputs equally.

### Associative Law

The grouping of operations doesn't matter when priority is the same:

- **AND**: $A \cdot (B \cdot C) = (A \cdot B) \cdot C$
- **OR**: $A + (B + C) = (A + B) + C$

**Applicable gates**: AND, OR gates follow this law, allowing multiple inputs to be processed in any grouping order.

### Distributive Law

Defines how operations distribute over parentheses:

- $A \cdot (B + C) = (A \cdot B) + (A \cdot C)$
- $A + (B \cdot C) = (A + B) \cdot (A + C)$

**Applicable gates**: This law applies when combining AND and OR operations in complex circuits.

### Identity Law

Variables remain unchanged when combined with specific constants:

- $A \cdot 1 = A$ (AND with 1)
- $A + 0 = A$ (OR with 0)

**Applicable gates**: AND gates with constant 1 input, OR gates with constant 0 input.

### Idempotent Law

A variable combined with itself yields the same variable:

- $A \cdot A = A$
- $A + A = A$

**Applicable gates**: AND and OR gates when both inputs are identical.

### De Morgan's Laws - The Most Important

De Morgan's laws are crucial for understanding gate equivalencies and circuit optimization.

#### First De Morgan's Law

$(A + B)' = A' \cdot B'$ - The complement of OR equals AND of complements

**Gate equivalency**: A **NOR gate** is equivalent to an **AND gate with inverted inputs**:

- NOR gate = NOT(A OR B)
- Bubbled AND = (NOT A) AND (NOT B)

#### Second De Morgan's Law

$(A \cdot B)' = A' + B'$ - The complement of AND equals OR of complements

**Gate equivalency**: A **NAND gate** is equivalent to an **OR gate with inverted inputs**:

- NAND gate = NOT(A AND B)
- Bubbled OR = (NOT A) OR (NOT B)

## Gates That Don't Follow Certain Laws

### XOR and XNOR Gates

These gates **do not follow the commutative law in the traditional sense** because they produce different outputs for different input combinations:

- XOR: Output is 1 only when inputs are different
- XNOR: Output is 1 only when inputs are the same

### NOT Gate

The NOT gate **cannot follow multi-input laws** like associative or distributive laws because it only accepts a single input. It follows the **double negation law**: $((A)')' = A$.

### Absorption Law Limitations

While mathematically valid ($A \cdot (A + B) = A$), this law has **limited practical application** in actual gate implementations because it represents circuit redundancy that would typically be eliminated during design.

## Simplification and Optimization

These laws enable circuit designers to **transform complex gate arrangements** into simpler, equivalent circuits, reducing component count and improving efficiency while maintaining identical logical functionality.
