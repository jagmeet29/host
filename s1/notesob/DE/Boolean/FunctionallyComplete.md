# Functionally Complete

![[Boolean_FunctionallyComplete.png|500]]
It refers to a **set of logic gates that can be used to implement any Boolean function**.

In simpler terms, a set of logic gates is functionally complete if you can create **any** digital circuit, no matter how complex, using only combinations of gates from that set.
## Common examples of functionally complete sets of logic gates are:

- **NAND gates alone:** You can implement AND, OR, and NOT logic just using NAND gates. Therefore, any digital circuit can be built using only NAND gates.
- **NOR gates alone:** Similarly, you can implement AND, OR, and NOT logic using only NOR gates. So, NOR gates alone are also functionally complete.
- **{AND, OR, NOT} gates:** This is a basic and intuitive set. With AND, OR, and NOT gates, you can directly implement any Boolean expression.
- **{AND, NOT} gates:** This set is also functionally complete because you can create an OR gate using AND and NOT gates (using De Morgan's Law).
- **{OR, NOT} gates:** This set is also functionally complete because you can create an AND gate using OR and NOT gates (using De Morgan's Law).
