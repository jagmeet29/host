### 3 Quick Practice Questions





>[!question] 1. What is $A ⊕ 1$?
>>[!success]- Answer
>>$Ā$ (negation)
>>
>>**Explanation:** When any variable is XORed with 1, the result is the negation of the variable. This is because: $A ⊕ 1 = Ā·1 + A·0 = Ā + 0 = Ā$.

>[!question] 2. If $A ⊕ B = C$, what is $A ⊕ C$?
>>[!success]- Answer
>>$B$ (exchange property)
>>
>>**Explanation:** XOR has an exchange property, which means that if $A ⊕ B = C$, then $A ⊕ C = B$. This is because: $A ⊕ C = A ⊕ (A ⊕ B) = (A ⊕ A) ⊕ B = 0 ⊕ B = B$.

>[!question] 3. What is $A ⊙ 0$?
>>[!success]- Answer
>>$Ā$ (negation with 0)
>>
>>**Explanation:** When any variable is XNORed with 0, the result is the negation of the variable. This is because: $A ⊙ 0 = \overline{(A ⊕ 0)} = \overline{A} = Ā$.

>[!question] 4. Does XNOR have an exchange property like XOR?
>>[!success]- Answer
>>No; $A ⊙ B = C$ does not imply $A ⊙ C = B$ because $A ⊙ A = 1$, not 0.
>>
>>**Explanation:** XNOR does not have an exchange property like XOR. This is because:
>>If $A ⊙ B = C$, then $A ⊙ C = A ⊙ (A ⊙ B) = (A ⊕ A) ⊙ B = 1 ⊙ B = \overline{B}$
>>However, $A ⊙ A = 1$, not 0, which means that the exchange property does not hold for XNOR in the same way it does for XOR.
