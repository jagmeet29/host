## What is a Serial Adder?

A **serial adder** is a digital circuit that performs binary addition one bit at a time, rather than processing all bits simultaneously like a parallel adder. This represents a trade-off between speed and hardware complexity.

### Key Characteristics

#### Advantages:

- **Hardware efficiency**: Requires only one full-adder circuit regardless of word length
- **Reduced silicon area**: Uses fewer components, making it ideal for VLSI implementations
- **Cost-effective**: Lower component count reduces manufacturing costs

#### Disadvantages:

- **Slower operation**: Takes multiple clock cycles (equal to the number of bits) to complete
- **Sequential nature**: Cannot process multiple additions simultaneously

## How Serial Addition Works

### Basic Components:

1. **Two shift registers** (A and B) to store the numbers
2. **One full-adder (FA)** circuit
3. **One D flip-flop** to store the carry bit
4. **Shift control logic**    

### Operation Process:

1. **Initialization**: Register A holds the augend, register B holds the addend, carry flip-flop is cleared
2. **Bit-by-bit processing**: Starting with least significant bits, the circuit adds one pair at a time
3. **Carry propagation**: The carry output is stored in the flip-flop for the next bit addition
4. **Result storage**: Sum bits are shifted into register A, replacing the original augend

### Sequential Circuit Design

The serial adder can be designed as a sequential circuit with:

- **Inputs**: x and y (from shift register outputs)
- **Output**: S (sum bit)
- **State**: Q (carry flip-flop)

The state table follows full-adder logic where:

- Present state Q = present carry
- Next state Q = output carry
- Output S = sum of x, y, and present carry
