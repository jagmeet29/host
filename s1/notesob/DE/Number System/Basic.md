# Number System in Digital Electronics - Study Notes

## Introduction

A number system is a mathematical system with a specific base that defines how numbers are represented and expressed using symbols or digits. In digital electronics, number systems are fundamental for representing information and performing operations in digital circuits. The number system provides a systematic way of expressing numbers and assigning their values using a set of symbols.

## Basic Terminology

### Key Terms

- **Base or Radix**: The number of symbols used in a number system. For example, the decimal system has base 10, and binary has base 2.

- **Radix Point**: A generalized form of decimal point that separates the integer part and fractional part of a number.

- **Bit**: A binary digit (0 or 1).

- **Nibble**: A group of four bits. Example: 0110, 1110.

- **Byte**: A group of eight bits. Example: 01101101, 11010011.

- **Most Significant Bit (MSB)**: The leftmost bit of a binary number with the highest place value.

- **Least Significant Bit (LSB)**: The rightmost bit of a binary number with the lowest place value.

## Detailed Number Systems

### Binary System

- Base: 2
- Digits: 0 and 1
- Representation: Each digit represents a power of 2.
- Example: The number 1101 in binary is $1 \cdot 2^3 + 1 \cdot 2^2 + 0 \cdot 2^1 + 1 \cdot 2^0 = 13$ in decimal.

### Octal System

- Base: 8
- Digits: 0 through 7
- Representation: Each digit represents a power of 8.
- Example: The number 172 in octal is $1 \cdot 8^2 + 7 \cdot 8^1 + 2 \cdot 8^0 = 122$ in decimal.

### Hexadecimal System

- Base: 16
- Digits: 0 through 9 and A through F (where A=10, B=11, ..., F=15)
- Representation: Each digit represents a power of 16.
- Example: The number 1A3 in hexadecimal is $1 \cdot 16^2 + 10 \cdot 16^1 + 3 \cdot 16^0 = 419$ in decimal.

### Decimal System

- Base: 10
- Digits: 0 through 9
- Representation: Each digit represents a power of 10.
- Example: The number 345 in decimal is $3 \cdot 10^2 + 4 \cdot 10^1 + 5 \cdot 10^0 = 345$ in decimal.
