# Intro

"Hello, I'm [Your Name], and I'm thrilled to be here today. As someone who's been fascinated by technology since childhood—where a simple software update on my phone could make my entire month—I've always been drawn to understanding how systems work and how they can be improved. That early curiosity evolved into a passion for electronics and communication engineering, where I've discovered my love for creating innovative solutions.

What excites me most about this opportunity at Lutron is how it sits at the intersection of my diverse interests. My background in AI and VLSI gives me a unique perspective on how intelligent systems can be integrated into lighting control, while my exploration of digital art has taught me the importance of user experience and aesthetic design—something crucial in total light control systems.

I'm someone who believes in the art of continuous exploration. Whether I'm diving deep into AI algorithms, working on VLSI designs, or creating digital art, I approach each with the same curiosity that made me explore every corner of those childhood software updates. I see this internship as an opportunity to bring that same exploratory mindset to product and systems operations, helping Lutron create lighting solutions that are not just functional, but truly transformative.

I'm particularly excited about how emerging technologies like AI can revolutionize lighting systems, making them more intuitive and responsive to human needs."
